This is the start of my ticTacToe game
It is currently run from the command line and there is no check for win condition and no error checking for user input
Pretty rudimentary(is that how you spell it) but hopefully to be improved very soon


Random Notes for future improvements
maybe make it up of some sort of node so that it can have an algorithm to check all the possible ways.
a board made of nodes then?
